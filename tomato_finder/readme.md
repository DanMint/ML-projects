# Tomato checker model#

In this project I trained a CNN model to predict if the tomato is good or bad. The accuracy of the model is 99%. It was trained upon 100 epoch.

*To run the code:* <br />
1)Load all the data in the repo <br />
2)Run the CSV_train(first_run_this).py to create a CSV file to tell the model where to train <br />
3)Run the main.py (Here we create the model it self) <br />
4)Run accuracy_test.py for accuracy <br />
