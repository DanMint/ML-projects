#Tomato checker model#

In this project I trained a CNN model to predict if the tomato is good or bad. The accuracy of the model is 99%. It was trained upon 100 epoch.

*To run the code:*
1)Load all the data in the repo
2)Run the CSV_train(first_run_this).py to create a CSV file to tell the model where to train
3)Run the main.py (Here we create the model it self)
4)Run accuracy_test.py for accuracy
